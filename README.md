# 🎗️ Cancer Prediction using Machine Learning 🎗️

## 📌 Overview
This project leverages machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of cancer. It utilizes a well-structured dataset containing diagnostic features and applies classification techniques to determine if a tumor is **malignant** or **benign**.

## 🔥 Key Features
- 📊 **Data preprocessing & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- 🤖 **Machine learning model training & evaluation**
- 🌐 **User-friendly Streamlit web application**
- 📈 **Interactive visualizations for insightful analysis**

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- 🐍 **Python**
- 🗃️ **Pandas, NumPy** for efficient data manipulation
- 🎨 **Matplotlib, Seaborn** for stunning visualizations
- 🏋️‍♂️ **Scikit-learn** for machine learning models
- 🌍 **Streamlit** for an interactive web application
- 🔊 **pyttsx3** for text-to-speech conversion (optional)

## ⚙️ Installation
### 🔽 Prerequisites
Ensure you have **Python 3.7+** installed.

### 📦 Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install all required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🚀 Usage
### 🎯 Running the Application
To launch the Streamlit web application, execute:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### 📂 Exploring the Data
A pre-generated **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) report** is available in `eda.html`, offering valuable insights into the dataset.

### 🏆 Model Training & Prediction
- The machine learning model is trained using **scikit-learn** and stored in `cancer_pl.pkl`.
- Predictions are generated in real-time when new data is input via the Streamlit interface.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used for training is available as **`cancer_prediction_data (2).csv`**. It contains multiple diagnostic features essential for tumor classification.
